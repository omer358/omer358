I'm Omer!, 22yo Computer Science student computer and software developer, for the last four years programming was my priority in life, so I'm good at it and I'm proud of myself and I'm willing to get better.

- I started with Android development in 2019, at the beginning of 2020 I start using Kotlin instead. Since that time I stopped my journey in Android development temporarily for hardware-related issues.
- At the end of 2020, I started exploring Python language, and I was fascinated by its simplicity and power, and I decided to enter the back-end world with its' framework Django so I can build restful APIs for my mobile app in the future.
- I'm looking for collaborating on building websites, meaning I'm gonna handle the back-end side😁.
