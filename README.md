I'm Omer!, 22yo Computer Science student💻 and software developer, for the last four years programming was my priority in life, so I'm good it and I'm proud of myself💛✨ and I'm willing to get better. 
- I started with Android development until 2019, at the beginning of 2020 I start using Kotlin instead. Since that time I stopped my journey in Android development temporarily for hardware-related issues.
- In the end of 2020 I started exploring Python language, and I was fascinated by its simplicity and power, and I decided to to enter the back-end world with its' framework Django so I can build restful APIs for my mobile app in the future.
- I'm looking for collaborate on building websites , meaning I'm gonna handle the back-end side😁.
